DOMAIN : MERN STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT

DURATION : 4 WEEKS

MENTOR : NEELA SANTOSH


About the Project:- 
The Weather Web Application is a full-stack project developed using the MERN stack principles with a React frontend and Node.js/Express backend. This application allows users to check real-time weather conditions for any city worldwide as well as fetch weather data automatically based on the user's current geographic location.

The project integrates the OpenWeatherMap API to provide accurate and up-to-date meteorological information including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

Designed with a modern and responsive user interface, the application ensures smooth user experience across devices while demonstrating practical implementation of API integration, backend development, and client-server communication.


## Features

1. Search weather by city name  
2. Auto-detect user location using Geolocation API  
3. Real-time weather data fetching  
4. Clean and responsive user interface  
5. Error handling for invalid city inputs  
6. RESTful API built with Express.js  
7. Secure API key management using environment variables  
8. Fast client-server communication  


## Tech Stack

Frontend:
- React.js  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Fetch API  

Backend:
- Node.js  
- Express.js  
- Axios  
- dotenv  

API:

## Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture:

Frontend:
Handles user interaction, UI rendering, and sends requests to the backend.

Backend:
Processes API requests, communicates with the OpenWeather API, and returns structured weather data.

External API:
Provides real-time weather information for accurate forecasting.


## Security Implementation

- API keys stored securely using environment variables  
- CORS enabled for safe client-server communication  
- Backend routing prevents direct exposure of API calls  


## Run Locally
